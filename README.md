# Google Clone Project

## Introduction

In this project I created a Google search clone, which takes advantage of 
Google's search engine and puts on top a personalized layout and theme. The 
clone also supports Google Images and Google's Advanced Search.

This was done imitating the aesthetics of Google, and using mainly HTML 5, CSS 
and Sass, which is compiled into a CSS file, used to stylized the HTML pages.

## Documentation
This clone consists of three pages:

1. `index.html`: it is a clone for the main Google search page. It includes
the "I'm Feeling Lucky" search button, which opens the first page result 
directly.
1. `google-images.html`: it is a clone for the Google Images search page.
1. `advanced-search.html`: it is a clone for the Google Advanced search page,
with four fields
    1. all these words
    1. this exact word or phrase
    1. any of these words
    1. none of these words
